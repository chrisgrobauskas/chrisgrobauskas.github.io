Did you take your team on vacation with you?  Did they go with you on your hike?  Were they floating on the lazy river next to you?  No?

## Time Off
If your team was negatively affected by your absence, *you* might be responsible for letting your team down.

Don’t take this the wrong way.  

> You should be able to leave work for a while without work piling up like garbage during a sanitation strike!

You will, however, need to make sure your team is prepared for your absence.

## High Performing Teams
High performing teams ensure no one is irreplaceable, cross-training each other as opportunities present themselves.  Or they create the opportunity by setting aside time.

When someone is on an extended absence, teammates step-up and handle tasks that cannot wait.

For important, time-sensitive tasks to get done while you are gone … your teammates will need to have the capability, confidence, and capacity to complete the tasks.

### Capability
Do you need to cross-train your teammates?

Some tasks may be self-explanatory to you, but are they for others?  The only way to find out is to work together to find out.

If someone is “hit by a bus”, your team should be able to keep moving forward.

Make sure everyone has a backup.

### Confidence
Do your teammates have confidence they can complete a task?  

Confidence normally means having done a task before, or at least being familiar with all the aspects of a task.  

Practice tasks together. Let the person learning “drive”.

Or it’s possible a teammate is capable but literally lacks confidence.  If this is the case, tell them you have confidence in them.  People do not read minds.

### Capacity 
Perhaps your team is over worked?

Team depth must include capacity to absorb workload changes. 

## Automation
Staffing may not be something you can change, but can you automate anything?  

Tasks that are automated won’t go waiting while you are gone.

## Please and Thank-you
Do teammates know they have your approval to help?  

Politely ask for help while you are out. Remember, say please and thank-you.

Happy Vacation!
