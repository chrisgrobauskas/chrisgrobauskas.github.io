Three worthy links to read:

## AI Risk
Bill Gates shared a balanced view on AI risk worth reading.

[LinkedIn - Gates Notes on "How to manage risks of AI"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-manage-risks-ai-bill-gates%3FtrackingId=VCG8HKeHDTOJsEM6i%252F0e5Q%253D%253D/?trackingId=VCG8HKeHDTOJsEM6i%2F0e5Q%3D%3D)

## ACM Generative AI Principles
The ACM Technology Policy Council has published principles for generative AI. While good governance is less exciting than delivering new features, it is important for practitioners to be responsible and thoughtful in their work. 

The most essential message in the document is listed last.

"Accountability and responsibility: Public and private bodies should be held accountable for decisions made by algorithms they use, even if it is not feasible to explain in detail how those algorithms produced their results."

## Satellite Security
The following press release and linked research paper are a good overview of cybersecurity issues with satellites.  Security through obscurity is alive and (un)well in at least some models.  The researchers found “hardly any modern security concepts were implemented”.

It was also interesting to learn AWS and Azure have Ground Station as a Service offerings from the paper.  

While the researchers only looked at three satellites, how easy would it be for a threat actor in real life to successfully take control of one or more satellites?
