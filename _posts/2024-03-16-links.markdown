## Dinner Plates for AI
Wow! The new Wafer Scale Engine 3 (WSE-3) chip is 8.5 × 8.5 inches (21.59 cm) and holds 900,000 AI cores to be used in Cerabas' CS-3 system. 

Combining 64 CS-3 systems, the Condor Galaxy 3 Supercomputer cluster will be housed in Texas and be used for training AI models. According to the company, it will be capable of up to 8 exaFLOPS at FP16.

### Condor Galaxy 3 Cluster Specs
- 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems
- 58 million AI cores 
- 164 Terabytes of memory
- 72,704 AMD Epyc Gen 3 Cores
- 776 terabits-per-second node-node fabric bandwidth

## Will Work For Hardware
In the AI race, having the right kind of data centers is a competitive advantage instead of a cost center for a select set of companies. 

The cost to operate the hardware required to train some models prices out even well-funded universities. In addition, higher salaries in industry have precipitated a brain drain from Academia. As a result, many research efforts may be privately funded or collaborative efforts between private and university researchers.

The WaPo article below discusses this, along with calls for more public funding for AI research. While I am generally supportive of public funding for research, would such funding be used to rent resources from existing providers or to fund new data centers for an existing National Laboratory?

## Guess I’ll Just Eat Worms
Researchers have tricked email assistants based on ChatGPT, Gemini, and LLaVA to send spam and exfiltrate personal data. 

This by itself is interesting, but they have also used them to create a worm by propagating the instructions to a recipient. Then, if that recipient is using a similar GenAI email assistant, it will in turn continue the cycle.

The researchers were able to do this with both text and image-based prompts.
