## Old-Time Rock & Roll
Bob Seger released the song “Old Time Rock & Roll” on his 1978 album *Stranger in Town*. Over the last year, I’ve seen a few articles about a renaissance in a mode of computing that went out of vogue around the same time, Analog Computing.

> "An analog computer or analogue computer is a type of computer that uses the continuous variation aspect of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities (analog signals) to model the problem being solved."

Analog computing is being looked at again due to energy efficiency. The company Mythic is even working on an Analog Matrix Processor (AMP) for use in AI applications!
