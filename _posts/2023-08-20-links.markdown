# OWASP LLM Top 10
Infosecurity Magazine has a good summary for the new "OWASP: Top 10 for LLMs".  I also recommend reading through the full version on the OWASP site.

Coupled with the recent CISA secure by default reminder and articles related to jailbreaking LLMs, it seems safe to assume current LLM Chatbots are NOT secure by default.

One recommendation from the OWASP Top 10 that may prove troublesome for those wanting to fine-tune models safely:

“Anything that is deemed sensitive in the fine-tuning data has the potential to be revealed to a user. Therefore, apply the rule of least privilege and do not train the model on information that the highest-privileged user can access which may be displayed to a lower-privileged user.”

# What is a security.txt file?
A security.txt file on your website helps security researchers report security vulnerabilities.

- Full disclosure … I hadn’t run across security.txt as being “a thing” before this week.
- A security.txt file on your site lets you provide contact information for how you want to receive reports from security researchers. 
- Consider if you would like to provide an email or a web form.  A secure web form is probably a better choice.
- Brian Krebs has reported that spam “security reports” go up with a security.txt file.

I am not convinced everyone needs to have a security.txt file in place.  If you have only a static web page, the cost of using email and wading through spam reports would be higher than any benefits.

I do think companies with bug bounty programs should have one in place to direct researchers to their bug bounty site.
