# Microsoft Key Management Not Crash Safe
🗝️ Microsoft has shared that a breach including US Government systems was caused by security keys being included in a crash dump.  Ars Technica reports, inclusion of the key in a dump was due to a software defect.

🚚 The crash dump was later moved from an isolated network to Microsoft’s corporate network, where it ultimately was accessed via a hacked account.

Things like this “should not happen” but it is only through the diligence of security professionals that they do not happen more frequently.

🦸‍♀️ Thank you to all the super security folks out there!

# Indemnification and AI
⚖️ Microsoft has agreed to indemnify users of its Copilot service from copyright claims with its new “Copilot Copyright Commitment”.

This development may ease decision makers minds on potential copyright claims stemming from using the service.  

In their announcement, Microsoft notes this is an extension of existing indemnification for potential patent claims while using Microsoft products.

🤑 Sometimes you get what you pay for, whether that is support or indemnification from various claims.

# Windows Server Clock Maladjustment
😲 When STS (Secure Time Seeding) is enabled on Windows Servers, system clocks have been seen to be reset randomly to times off by months or years!

👉 Ars Technica reports it is most likely related to the algorithm in use pulling timestamps from SSL handshakes, but there is no guarantee these timestamps are correct.

Browse through the article in the comments section, and consider if you should follow the recommendation to disable STS if you are running Windows Server and can retrieve accurate times from NTP (network time protocol) in your environment.
