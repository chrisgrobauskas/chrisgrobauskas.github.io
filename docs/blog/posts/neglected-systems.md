It’s tempting to view Mainframe, distributed, and cloud systems as a linear progression from old to new. But in reality, systems are bundles of trade-offs. Every platform, no matter how popular, comes with both strengths and weaknesses.

You can choose one platform or follow a hybrid strategy, but the one thing you can’t do is stop investing in the platforms you rely on.

If you underinvest (or worse disinvest) in the platforms you depend on, don’t be surprised when they become rigid, outdated, or harder to evolve. This applies equally to technology providers and any business with a meaningful tech footprint.

Investment must include the people who run, maintain, and grow these systems. They’re just as critical to your technology portfolio as the platforms themselves.

You can’t neglect talent development and then wonder why you can’t hire. Without entry-level roles and mentorship, you’re guaranteeing a talent gap in the future. There won’t be mid-career experts a decade from now … at least not ones who aren’t approaching retirement.

The most dangerous systems aren’t old or new. The most dangerous systems are neglected systems.

It’s time we stopped thinking about technology purely in terms of tech stacks and architecture. These aren’t just platforms.

They’re ecosystems, and the people who live within them need care, investment, and opportunities to thrive.
