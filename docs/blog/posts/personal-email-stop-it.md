# Stop It!
An interesting article giving yet another example of why you should not use a personal email for work correspondence!

<!-- more -->

An Internet provider for the Mali domain has been receiving emails intended for military domains.  According to the article, emails sent from military systems block outgoing email to these domains, but obviously email sent from private providers would not do the same.

While the information disclosed does not appear to include any classified information, the article indicates sensitive information was included in some emails.

Do you use your work email for personal correspondence or vice versa?

Please stop doing that.
