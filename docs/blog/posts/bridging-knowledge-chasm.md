For many seasoned professionals in tech, “We’re not gonna take it” isn’t just a rock anthem — it’s the quiet refrain of those who’ve carried the weight of critical systems, late-night incidents, and relentless change.

Everyone retires eventually. But the knowledge chasm beyond the retirement cliff for those who’ve built, run, and sustained mission-critical systems is a growing crisis for many technology teams and the business functions they enable.

These professionals aren’t just skilled workers; they’re stewards with profound system knowledge, historical context, and the undocumented “why” behind how things actually work.

When they leave, they often take decades of insight with them. What remains is usually a brief, semi-structured handoff, if that.

We need a better bridge across the knowledge chasm.

Flexible employment options — ike part-time roles, short-term consulting, and targeted mentorship — can help build that bridge without overloading people approaching retirement.

Remote work should absolutely be on the table. Many would gladly contribute if they could do it from closer to family or even while finally traveling.

Pair that flexibility with a clear, personalized knowledge transfer plan. Define goals and structure the engagement to make the most of every hour shared between mentor and mentee.

Most mentors want to share their experience. In conversations with colleagues near retirement, I hear it again and agaiw — there’s real pride in passing on what they know.

But mentors require the time, space, and structure to do it right. And just as importantly, they require mentees — people committed, assigned, and accountable to learn and carry that knowledge forward.

Flexible transition arrangements aren’t just kind — they’re strategic. They won’t be needed for every retirement, but they’re an option to provide continuity, reduce risk, and avoid the cost of overlapping two full-time roles.

Offered early, they encourage open conversations about retirement timing — giving teams the time to prepare rather than scramble.

Let’s listen and respond with thoughtful, flexible solutions that honor experience and protect essential systems and institutional knowledge.
