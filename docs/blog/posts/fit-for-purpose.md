While I start my day with coffee, I’ve been sipping hot tea for the rest of it lately. (Exciting, right?) But there’s a bigger point here.

<!-- more -->

My gas stove is very slow at boiling water, so I looked into switching to an induction stove. It would be faster and more efficient, but my kitchen isn’t wired for it. Plus, buying an entirely new stove would be expensive and, honestly, over-engineered for solving the problem of boiling water faster.

Instead, I spent $15 on an electric kettle. It solved the problem quickly, without a hefty price tag.

Why should you care?

Think about a problem you’re facing:

- Do you truly understand the real problem?
- Is there a simple solution?

While this example may seem trivial, it’s a reminder that knowing exactly what problem you’re solving is key to finding solutions that are fit for purpose. Moreover, the simplest and most direct solution is often the most cost-effective one.
