A security.txt file on your website helps security researchers report security vulnerabilities.

<!-- more -->

- Full disclosure … I hadn’t run across security.txt as being “a thing” before this week.
- A security.txt file on your site lets you provide contact information for how you want to receive reports from security researchers. 
- Consider if you would like to provide an email or a web form.  A secure web form is probably a better choice.
- Brian Krebs has reported that spam “security reports” go up with a security.txt file.

I am not convinced everyone needs to have a security.txt file in place.  If you have only a static web page, the cost of using email and wading through spam reports would be higher than any benefits.

I do think companies with bug bounty programs should have one in place to direct researchers to their bug bounty site.

Site to help you create a security.txt file:
