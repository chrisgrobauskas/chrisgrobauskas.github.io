#  Chris Grobauskas' Blog 
I am a Senior Technology Engineer at State Farm Insurance, but the perspectives you find on this site are entirely my own.

After twenty-five years exploring technology across platforms like Unix, Linux, Mainframe, and AWS, I'm filled with a sense of wonder and optimism for what we can build.

This blog is my way of sharing what excites me and hopefully offering a little encouragement.
