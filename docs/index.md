#  Chris Grobauskas' Blog 
After twenty-five years exploring technology across platforms like Unix, Linux, Mainframe, and AWS, I'm filled with a sense of wonder and optimism for what we can build.

This blog is my way of sharing what excites me and hopefully offering a little encouragement.

## About
I am a Senior Technology Engineer at State Farm Insurance, but the perspectives you find on this site are entirely my own. Beyond my professional life, I am a father, a husband, an avid reader, and a fan of the Oxford comma. I find joy in experimenting with technology, staying current with its ever-changing tides, and reflecting on the stories it tells.
